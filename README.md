# VPN Setup and Privacy Evaluation 
Elevate labs cybersecurity internship task-8: Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication 


## üéØ Objective  
Understand the role of **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)** in protecting privacy and secure communication.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used  
- **ProtonVPN Free Tier** (VPN Client)  
- **whatismyipaddress.com** (for IP verification)  
- **Web Browser (Chrome)**  

---

## üìå Steps Taken  

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Chose a VPN Service  
- Selected **ProtonVPN Free Tier** due to:  
  - Unlimited free bandwidth.  
  - Strong AES-256 encryption.  
  - Strict no-logs policy.  
  - Reputation for privacy and security.  

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Download and Install Client  
- Signed up for a free account on [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).  
- Downloaded and installed the **ProtonVPN client** for my operating system.  

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Connected to VPN Server  
- Opened ProtonVPN app.  
- Chose the **closest free server** (Netherlands/USA/Japan).  
- Successfully connected.  

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Verified IP Address  
- Visited [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/).  
- Confirmed my **IP address changed** to the VPN server location.  

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Checked Encrypted Traffic  
- Browsed multiple websites.  
- Verified data traffic was **encrypted and secure**.  

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Disconnected and Compared  
- Disconnected VPN.  
- Checked IP again ‚Äî reverted back to my original ISP IP.  
- Browsing speed was slightly faster without VPN, but still acceptable with VPN.  

### ‚úÖ Step 7: Researched VPN Security Features  
- **Encryption Used:** AES-256 bit encryption + Secure Core routing.  
- **Privacy:** No-logs policy, protects against ISP monitoring.  
- **Extra Features:** Kill switch, DNS leak protection.  

### ‚úÖ Step 8: Summary of Benefits and Limitations  

#### üîí Benefits:  
- Hides real IP address ‚Üí **enhances anonymity**.  
- Encrypts internet traffic ‚Üí **prevents ISP/government snooping**.  
- Allows secure use of public Wi-Fi.  
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions (limited in free plan).  

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:  
- Free servers are limited to few countries.  
- Browsing speed can be slower due to server load.  
- Some websites may block VPN traffic.

## üìñ Conclusion  
By completing this task, I learned that VPNs:  
- ‚≠ê Play a vital role in **privacy protection**.  
- ‚≠ê Secure communication by **encrypting data**.  
- ‚≠ê Provide anonymity by **masking IP addresses**.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Free VPNs come with certain restrictions, but they are still valuable for basic security.
